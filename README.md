## How to run Tests 
All the test triggering is done through maven commands, this framework supports multiple different types of 
test executions such as smoke, regression, and end-to-end on different possible environment such as QA, Staging, and 
UAT. 
#### Executing specific tests 
If you would like to exeucte a specific test that are stated on testng.xml file
```shell script
mvn test -Dtestof="smoke_api"
```

If you would like to execute all of the tests that are stated on testng.xml file 
```shell script
mvn test 
```

If you would like to execute multiple different types of test stated on testng.xml file 
```shell script
mvn test -Dtestof="test1", "test2", "test3"
```

If you would like to execute a specific test on specific environment ( default=UAT ) 
```shell script
mvn test -Dtestof="test1" -Denv="Staging"
```
